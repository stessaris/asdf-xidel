# asdf-xidel [![Build](https://github.com/stessaris/asdf-xidel/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stessaris/asdf-xidel/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Lint](https://github.com/stessaris/asdf-xidel/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stessaris/asdf-xidel/actions/workflows/lint.yml)

[Xidel](https://www.videlibri.de/xidel.html) plugin for the [asdf version manager](https://asdf-vm.com). This plugin fetches availablee `Xidel` binaries from different sources: for the latest stable release (0.9.8) uses the official repo [benibela/xidel](https://github.com/benibela/xidel), while the up to date 0.9.9 version (aligned with the documentation) is retrieved from the fork [deep-soft/xidel](https://github.com/deep-soft/xidel) (version is tagged with `0.9.9-beta`). The reason is that the official download page provides only nightly builds (see [Xidel - Downloads](https://www.videlibri.de/xidel.html#downloads) for details). For OSX, only Intel builds are available.
